## Association between Activated Loci of HML-2 Primate-Specific Endogenous Retrovirus and Newly Formed Chromatin Contacts in Human Primordial Germ Cell-like Cells

**Abstract:** The pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived human primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) are a cell culture-derived surrogate model of 
embryonic primordial germ cells. Upon differentiation of PSCs to PGCLCs, multiple loci of HML-2, the hominoid-specific human endogenous retrovirus 
(HERV), are strongly activated, which is necessary for PSC differentiation to PGCLCs. In PSCs, strongly activated loci of HERV-H family HERVs create 
chromatin contacts, which are required for the pluripotency. Chromatin contacts in the genome of human PSCs and PGCLCs were determined by Hi-C 
sequencing, and their locations were compared with those of HML-2 loci strongly activated in PGCLCs but silenced in the precursor na√Øve iPSCs. 
In both iPSCs and PGCLCs, the size of chromatin contacts were found to be around one megabase, which corresponds to the Topologically Associated Domains 
in the human genome but is slightly larger in PGCLCs than iPSCs. The number of small-sized chromatin contacts diminished while numbers of larger-sized 
contacts increased. The distances between chromatin contacts newly formed in PGCLCs and the degrees of activation of the closest HML-2 loci showed 
significant inverse correlation. Our study provides evidence that strong activation of HML-2 provirus loci may be associated with newly formed chromatin
contacts in their vicinity, potentially contributing to PSC differentiation to the germ cell lineage.
